Reflection:

As far is data types are concerned, to load the data into the table, I have used property types since I feel it was important to use in order to maintain pure MVC architecture. Mostly the model classes holds the data in primitive type, and the classes in View are responsible to load the data into the tables. However, passing the model class' object directly to the classes in View would not follow the rules of architecture, hence I used a wrapper class for both Part and Product, through which the data can be passed to the classes in View. Later on View classes use Property types to fetch the data through the wrapper class and loan it in the table. Hence, in my opinion the utilization of property types becomes crucial in case you want to stick with the MVC architecture pattern.
